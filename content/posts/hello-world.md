## Starting Something New

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm James Merrill, COO at [Future Present Labs](https://fpl.dev), where we're building the infrastructure for the next generation of American manufacturing.

## My Background

I'm a University of Washington graduate with a degree in Real Estate and Business. During college, I worked on several startups and different companies, which gave me early exposure to the business world and a taste for building things.

After graduation, I started an event business with friends. What began as hosting private events evolved into curating luxury experiences for high net worth individuals in Bellevue and Seattle, featuring a private speakeasy-like lounge venue.

From there, I transitioned into the luxury goods space with a caviar business—selling premium caviar to the same high-end clientele I'd built relationships with. We're currently preparing for a brand launch at the end of this month.

Now, my main focus is Future Present Labs, where I run operations and oversee system design and new integrations.

## What to Expect Here

This blog will be a mix of:

- **Operations & Strategy** — Lessons from scaling manufacturing operations, building businesses across industries, and developing operational frameworks
- **Entrepreneurship** — Thoughts on starting and growing ventures, from events to luxury goods to hard tech
- **Industry Analysis** — Insights on reshoring, industrial policy, and the future of making things in America
- **Building in Public** — Updates on what we're building at FPL and why it matters
- **Personal Reflections** — The occasional deeper dive into leadership, decision-making, and the journey of building something meaningful

## Why Manufacturing?

We're at an inflection point in American manufacturing. The CHIPS Act, Infrastructure Bill, and shifting geopolitical realities have created a window where reshoring isn't just patriotic—it's practical. But the infrastructure to support it doesn't exist yet.

That's what we're building at FPL.
