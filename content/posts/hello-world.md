## Starting Something New

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm James Merrill, COO at [Future Present Labs](https://futurepresentlabs.com), where we're building the infrastructure for the next generation of American manufacturing.

## What to Expect Here

This blog will be a mix of:

- **Operations & Strategy** — Lessons from scaling manufacturing operations and building resilient supply chains
- **Industry Analysis** — Thoughts on reshoring, industrial policy, and the future of making things
- **Building in Public** — Updates on what we're building at FPL and why it matters
- **Personal Reflections** — The occasional deeper dive into leadership, decision-making, and the journey of building something meaningful

## Why Now?

We're at an inflection point in American manufacturing. The CHIPS Act, Infrastructure Bill, and shifting geopolitical realities have created a window where reshoring isn't just patriotic—it's practical. But the infrastructure to support it doesn't exist yet.

That's what we're building.

## Get in Touch

If you're working on something interesting in manufacturing, operations, or industrial tech, I'd love to hear from you. [Drop me a line](/contact) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jamesmerrill).

Thanks for reading.

— James
