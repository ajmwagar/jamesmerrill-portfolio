## James Merrill

**COO at [Future Present Labs](https://futurepresentlabs.com)**

I'm an operations leader and strategist focused on building the future of American manufacturing. At Future Present Labs, I lead our operational strategy, partnerships, and execution as we develop the infrastructure to make domestic manufacturing competitive again.

### What I Do

**Operations & Strategy**
- Scaling manufacturing operations from prototype to production
- Building resilient, geographically distributed supply chains
- Developing operational frameworks for hardware startups

**Manufacturing Technology**
- Agentic manufacturing systems and AI-driven workflows
- Digital infrastructure for manufacturer matching and quoting
- Supply chain visibility and optimization

**Industrial Policy & Reshoring**
- Navigating the regulatory and policy landscape for domestic manufacturing
- Building partnerships across the industrial ecosystem
- Advocating for strategic manufacturing capabilities

### Background

[This section can be customized with your specific background, previous roles, education, etc.]

### What I'm Building

At Future Present Labs, we're creating:

- **AgentRFQ** — An open standard for machine-to-manufacturer communication
- **AI-powered CAD tools** — Generate RFQ-ready parts from natural language
- **Domestic supplier networks** — Connecting hardware builders with American manufacturers

Our mission is simple: make it as easy to manufacture in Texas as it is in Shenzhen.

### Outside of Work

When I'm not thinking about manufacturing operations, you can find me [customize with your interests: hiking, reading, brewing coffee, etc.].
